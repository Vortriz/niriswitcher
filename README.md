# niriswitcher

An application switcher for niri

## Installation

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/isaksamsten/niriswitcher.git
```

### Requirements

The following system packages:
- `python3-gobject`
- `python3-devel`
- `gtk4-layer-shell`

These are the names of the packages on Fedora, but I'm sure they are
distributed for other distributions.
